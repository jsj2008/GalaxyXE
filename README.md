# GalaxyXE
GalaxyXE is a OpenGL and C++ game engine designed for 3D graphics.
This engine is currently bound to another parallel project, a game (as expected).
Further updates are scheduled as the game itself is not playable. However the basic graphics intreface is programmable and executable.

This file is to be updated.
